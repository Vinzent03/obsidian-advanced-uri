There are multiple ways to identify a file:

- [File path](#file-path)
- [File name](#file-name)
- [Daily note](#daily-note)
- [Key in frontmatter](#key-in-frontmatter)

> [!caution]
> Make sure your values are properly [encoded](Concepts/Encoding.md)
> 

## File path

- Key: `filepath`
- Value: Relative path to the vault
- Example: `hobbies/soccer.md` / `hobbies/soccer`
- Note: You can omit the file extension `.md`.

## File name

- Key: `filename`
- Value: Only the name of the file without the actual path
- Example: `soccer` / `soccer.md`
- Note: You can omit the file extension `.md`. It prefers just the file name, like when linking via `[[fileName]]`, causing aliases to be supported.


## Daily note

- Key: `daily`
- Value: `true`
- Example: `daily=true`
- Note: To use the current daily note simply set the key to `true`. If it doesn't exist already, it will be created. 

## Key in frontmatter

- Key: `uid`
- Example: `uid=d43f7a17-058c-4aea-b8dc-515ea646825a`
- Use case: Some users prefer navigating to specific notes per UUID instead of the file path to be able to rename these files, but to keep the link still working.
- Note: By enabling that option in the setting, every generated command with the `filepath` parameter is replaced with the `uid` parameter. The uid is either read from the frontmatter or generated and then written to the frontmatter. 

> [!info]
> [Navigation](Actions/Navigation.md) with `uid` is always supported and doesn't need the setting to be enabled.
> 

> [!info]
> By specifying `uid` and `filepath` it creates a new file, if no file with `uid` exists, at `filepath` and writes `uid` to the frontmatter.

## Examples
1)
`obsidian://advanced-uri?&filepath=Inbox`
This will open a note "Inbox" in your Obsidian vault even if there is no Inbox note present in your vault.

2)
`obsidian://advanced-uri?daily=true&heading=Inbox`
This will open your daily note and place the cursor under Inbox heading if there is one.

3)
Suppose you have a note called Inbox which has an alias "Brain Dumps". Now comes the use case for the `filename` parameter.
Use this command
`obsidian://advanced-uri?filename=Brain%20Dumps`
