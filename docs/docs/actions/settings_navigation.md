## Setting Sections

In addition to navigating to a specific setting, you can also navigate to a specific section of a setting. This is useful if you want to open a specific setting and have it scrolled into view. Use the additional `settingsection` parameter for this purpose. The parameter's value is the exact case-sensitive section name.
