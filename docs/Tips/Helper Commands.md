There are multiple helper commands to generate the URI for you.

- Copy URI for file
  - When you are in a heading or block with a reference, a URI to navigate to that heading/block is copied to your clipboard. Otherwise, a modal is opened, where you can type in your data that should be written to the current file.
- Copy URI for daily note
- Copy URI for search and replace
- Copy URI for command
